To compute the annualized volatility of a stock based on historical data, we follow these steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Calculate the daily returns using the formula:
    \[
    \text{Daily Return} = \frac{\text{Price}_t - \text{Price}_{t-1}}{\text{Price}_{t-1}}
    \]
    where $\text{Price}_t$ is the stock price on day $t$, and $\text{Price}_{t-1}$ is the stock price on the previous day.
    
    \item Compute the standard deviation of the daily returns to measure the daily volatility.
    
    \item Annualize the volatility by multiplying the standard deviation of the daily returns by the square root of the number of trading days in a year (usually 252):
    \[
    \text{Annualized Volatility} = \text{Standard Deviation of Daily Returns} \times \sqrt{252}
    \]
\end{enumerate}
